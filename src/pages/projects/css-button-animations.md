I wanted to sharpen my `CSS` skills. While I know `CSS` code, I'm not very good with animations. I followed along this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH0TC9gWiAg) by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) to create these button animations.

The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-button-animations).
