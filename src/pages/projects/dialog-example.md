Here is a demo I built featuring the [dialog element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog). I found out about this new element from Kevin Powell's video [dialog = the easiest way to make a popup modal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAB_v6yBXIE&t=0s).

I decided to build my own demo to explore and play around with this new element. I built 2 dialogs--a simple one and a form one. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-davdevs-gatsby), where you can view my code and perhaps give you some inspiration on how to use this new `dialog` element.

Here are some simple how-tos:

- The dialog element comes with its own pseudo element, `::backdrop` which gives you--as you guessed it, ability to style the backdrop of the dialog.
- To open the dialog via **JavaScript**, use the `showModal()` function on the `dialog` element.
- To close the dialog, use the `close()` function.
