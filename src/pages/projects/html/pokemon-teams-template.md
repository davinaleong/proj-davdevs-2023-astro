This project is the first part of a 2-part project I'm in the midst of building. The second part is to build this project in `ReactJS`.

I first sketched up the mockups of the app pages in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/).

I then built the template in `HTML` and `SASS`, using the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemlabel=ritwickdey.live-sass) [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension to compile the `SASS` scripts.

This template features **CSS Grid** and **Flex**. **CSS Grid** is used to lay out the main components like the sidebar and main sections, and **Flex** is used to lay out the Team-cards.

`jQuery` is used to render the Team-cards and the Team-list on the sidebar. Dummy team data is stored in a `JSON` file and is pulled in and displayed by the Team-cards.
