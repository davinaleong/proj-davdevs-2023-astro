This project was built in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). It includes a [Markdown Editor](https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor) for me to style my blog content like adding headings and links. The [Architect UI](https://dashboardpack.com/live-demo-preview/?livedemo=290) is used for the dashboard UI.

The main focus of this project was to build a headless CMS to house all my projects' content information. As I have a day job, I didn't want to spend time designing an admin dashboard myself. I also took this opportunity to keep myself updated with current technologies and trends such as moving from HTML (CK Editor) editors to Markdown ones and using Laravel 8.

I have also built a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) endpoint in this project. Unfortunately, I'm unable to get the GUI to work on production.
