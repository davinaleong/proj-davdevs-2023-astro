I wanted to build an API project to sharpen my skills. I also wanted to learn how to deploy an API. This project has 2 parts: the CMS and API. The CMS for users to update the database, and the API to request the data stored in the database. I decided to use the Bible as a theme for this project as I have an understanding of the Bible structure.

This is an ongoing project. I have yet to setup the domain and HTTPS. This project is built in Laravel and is deployed on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) using [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/). This project includes testing with Laravel's integration of [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).
