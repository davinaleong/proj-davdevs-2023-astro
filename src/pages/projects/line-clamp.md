This project was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6iVByCOx8A) by Kevin Powell.

I also used a different colour scheme to differenciate my project from Kevin's. The color scheme I used was chosen from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). It's a useful website to choose color schemes quickly.
