This template is the first part of a 2-part demo I was building. I was asked to give a talk on [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/) at a local `PHP` meetup. Hence, the aim of this demo was to showcase CraftCMS.

This project was built in Bootrap 4. The icons are from [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/). To maintain code readability and reusability, I used `SASS` as the `CSS` pre-processor. Note that this project doesn't come bundled with its own _`SASS` compiler_, as I was lazy to code up one ðŸ˜›... If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can simply use the free [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) VS Code extension.

[Write up](https://dev.to/davinaleong/released-my-first-bootstrap-4-template-2b00) on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/).

I came up with the idea of creating a fake company. This company specializes in developing custom web and mobile applications for clients. The audience of the talk was a local `PHP` community. Hence, I came up with the company's name "Comphanny" which is a play on the words "company", "php", and "ph" being pronunced as "f" in "elephant" which is the animal typically associated with `PHP`.

I initally wanted to build this template from scratch, to practise my `CSS` & web design skills, as well as explore **Flex** and **CSS Grid**. But due to time constraint from my day job, and still having the CraftCMS part of the project to build, I felt it was too ambitious. So I decided to go building off Bootstrap since it was what I was familiar with.
