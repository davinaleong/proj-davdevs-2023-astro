Here is a microsite containing links to the projects I built for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges. The repo for the microsite can be found [here](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-dav-fem).

This microsite is built in `HTML` and `CSS`. **CSS Grid** is used for the main layout, layout of the project cards and card buttons. I used `JSON` to store the project details and deployed it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Feel free to view the code of the challenges and perhaps learn something from them.
