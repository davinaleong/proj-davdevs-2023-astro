This project is built using **Bootstrap 4**.

I built this template with the mindset that it should be usable right out of the box, with minimal setup required. I often find myself in need of a simple, pure Bootstrap 4 template. I find many of the admin dashboard templates I've come across online overly engineered and complicated to setup and use.

Feel free to use this template for your own admin-dashboard projects.

This project also comes packaged with packages I use quite often in my web-development projects.

Included packages: `ParsleyJS` for _form validation_, `DataTables` - _sort, search and paginate table data_, `MomentJS` - _format date-times_, `Tempus Dominus` - _datetime picker_, `PrismJS` - _syntax highlighting_.
