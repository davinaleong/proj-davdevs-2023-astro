This project is built using `ReactJS`.

I started by developing the template for the app first. The template is built in `HTML`, with `SASS` as its `CSS` pre-processor. Once the template is done, I then re-build the app in `ReactJS`. I also decided to take advantage of this opportunity to try my hand at **CSS Grid**. CSS Grid is used to layout the app's components. I used **Flex** to layout the cards on the Chapters page.

I use the templating phase to help me plan out the placement of elements as well as the app's styles.

This app is deployed on **Netlify**.

Feel free to play around with the app! ðŸ˜Š
