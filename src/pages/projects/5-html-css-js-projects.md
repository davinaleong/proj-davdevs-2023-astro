I did these 5 projects following this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkeyKeK3V24&t=91s) by [Traversey Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia). I still have not figured out where I would use these components. Perhaps I would implement the content placeholder when I revamp this Dav/Devs site. Hopefully I will be able to find time for such a project!
